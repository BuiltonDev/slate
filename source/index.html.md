# Introduction

Welcome to the Shareactor API! Our APIs intend to provide businesses with the capability of porting their backends into our platform and start worrying with other things rather than tech!

We have language bindings in Shell and Python! You can view code examples in the dark area to the right, and you can switch the programming language of the examples with the tabs in the top right.
